## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

**Four key concepts** 
- **Branching**:
  - Helped me separate features and prevent conflicts when working on            different site sections. 
- **Commit Messages**:
  - Using structured and meaningful commit messages helped me track changes.
  - It became easier to understand what was done at each stage. An Example       of a commit message I used was: "feat: add an avatar icon for chikuro".
- **Pull Requests and Code Review**:
  - Pull requests enabled me to review and test changes before merging them      into the main branch.
  - I also put myself as the reviewer since it was a personal project. 
- **Issues and Milestones**:
  - Creating issues for each task and linking them to milestones helped          break down the work into small, manageable parts.


## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

> Upload the screenshots to your GitHub repository and reference them here using Markdown image syntax:
> (you could just simply copy and paste the image into the Assignment.md)

### A. Milestones and Issues

- ![Milestones](assets/Milestones.png)
- I used milestones to group related issues under major deliverables like "Landing Page" and "Personal Profile". This helped track progress at a higher level and ensured I stayed on schedule for completing key project phases.

### B. Project Board

- ![Project Board](assets/ProjectBoard.png) 
- This board helped me organize all tasks using columns like *To Do*, *In Progress*, and *Done*. Each issue was dragged to the appropriate column as progress was made.
### C. Branching

- ![Branching](assets/Branches.png)
- This screenshot shows the different branches I created for separate features. Branching helped me avoid conflicts by allowing feature development in isolation before merging to `main`.

### D. Pull Requests
- ![Pull Requests](assets/MergeRequest.png)
- Pull requests were used to review changes from feature branches before merging to `main`. I assigned myself as the reviewer for each pull request.

### E. Merge Conflict Resolution
