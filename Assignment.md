## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

**Four key concepts** 
- **Branching**: Helped me separate features and prevent conflicts when working on different site sections. 
- **Commit Messages**:
  - Using structured and meaningful commit messages helped me track changes.
  - It became easier to understand what was done at each stage. An Example       of a commit message I used was: "feat: add an avatar icon for chikuro".
- **Pull Requests and Code Review**:
  - Pull requests enabled me to review and test changes before merging them      into the main branch.
  - I also put myself as the reviewer since it was a personal project. 
- **Issues and Milestones**:
  - Creating issues for each task and linking them to milestones helped          break down the work into small, manageable parts.
